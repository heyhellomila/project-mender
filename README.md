This web application uses the following technologies:

-   _Express_, a Node.js back-end framework
-   _MongoDB_, a cross-platform document-oriented database
-   _React Native_, an application framework

```
node --version
```

### Installing Dependencies

Before starting, make sure you have working versions of npm (6.12+) and Node (12.9.0+).

### Database Set Up

Necessary dependencies must be installed for both parts of the application.

For the back-end, execute:
```shell
cd backend/
npm install
```
For the front-end, execute:
```shell
cd frontend/
npm install
```

### Running the Back-end Server

To start the back-end server, use the following command from `backend/`:

```
npm start
```

### Running the Front-end Server

To start the front-end server, use the following command from `frontend/`:

```
npm start
```

Note that both servers must be running as separate processes for the application to function.
